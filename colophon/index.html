    <p id="colophon-text">One font this website uses is <a href="https://www.emigre.com/Fonts/Mrs-Eaves-XL-Serif-and-Narrow" target="_blank">Mrs Eaves XL</a>. The typeface was designed by Zuzana Licko in 2009 to provide comfort when reading. It's a follow-up design to her popular Mrs Eaves - the original font - with a larger x-height, shorter ascenders and descenders, and overall tighter spacing.<br><br>
    Another Licko font, also from 2009, is its Modern alternative; <a href="https://www.emigre.com/Fonts/Mr-Eaves-XL-Sans-and-Modern" target="_blank">Mr Eaves XL</a>. This typeface has simpler, more geometric-looking shapes and has moved furthest from its roots, yet still contains some of Mrs Eavesâ€™ design.<br><br>
    For headers, this site uses <a href="https://www.emigre.com/Fonts/Blockhead-Alphabet" target="_blank">Blockhead Alphabet</a> - designed by John Hersey in 1995.<br><br><br><br>
    This site was built from scratch using HTML, CSS and a little Javascript. It was written in VS Studio Code, with some help from Chat GPT, and is currently hosted via Github Pages.<br><br>
