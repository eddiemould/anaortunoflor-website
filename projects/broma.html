        <h2>Broma</h2>
        <p class="text-panel-main">Broma is a pop-up cocktail bar project which started as a rejection to convoluted drinks, commercial softs, and overly sweet cocktails. Based in Edinburgh, the brand believes in a botanically-driven menu, with low ABV and intriguing soft drinks. Broma forages their ingredients and crafts infusions, liqueurs, and syrups. Broma chooses to work with people who inspire them.<br><br>
        The brand identity reflects what Broma believes in. The illustrations aim to capture the personality of each drink, specially made for their current menu. Not looking for quantity but for purposeful design choices. Like the cocktail's ingredients, the attention to detail is crucial, seen through different types of glasses, characters and colours. The 'sketchy-ness' of the illustrations gives the brand a playful, modern and hand crafted look.</p><br>
