        <p>Hola!<br><br>
        I am a UK based illustrator from Barcelona who grew up between Spain, Chile, and England. I graduated in 2024 from Graphic Design and Illustration at Liverpool School of Art and Design. I enjoy printmaking, reportage illustration, puppet making and lots of drawing.<br><br>
        Playfulness and curiosity are intrinsic to my practice. I draw daily, my most loved subjects (as of writing this) include - trees, rocks, people, mountains, and things in between. I create with everything, however my most recent fascination is liquid graphite. Visual storytelling is a key aspect of my work. I like to explore how to capture the essence of a moment on paper. Languages and culture are recurring themes in my work. I experience the world through making, and try to create stuff that feels hopeful, and fun.<br><br>
        I have taken part in print fairs such as <a href="https://www.lookoutillustrationfair.co.uk/" target="_blank">Lookout</a>. I love meeting members of the public, sharing my work and being part of a creative community. I have greeting cards stocked at <a href="https://www.writeherekitenow.co.uk" target="_blank">Write Here Pens</a>, in Shrewsbury.<br><br>
        I facilitate workshops - please see the <a href="#/workshops/index.html">workshops</a> section of my website.<br><br>
        Let's chat! I would love to hear about any projects, commissions or ideas you may have.<br><br>
